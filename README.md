# LiteFusion - Diffussion image generator.
## Installation
1. Cloning repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ImHacker890-890/LiteFusion
cd LiteFusion
```
2. Installing requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

python generation.py
```
## Features
**Ease of use** - easy usage and installation.

**Fast Generation** - no longer generations

**Coco trainer** - model trained on cool dataset.
## Model
The model can run not only on powerful hardware with a GPU, since it is not large in size.
>**Note:**
>This model is not designed for very elaborate and powerful generation.
>For working with complex prompts, it is recommended to use more complex models such as Deep Floyd IF.
